Research Question1: 
Description1:
My actual idea is to compare the "Reggeaton" which is often described as a successor of hip hop to German hip hop. Reggeaton is becoming more and more popular all over the world and is listened by people who do not even unterstand the lyrics in spanish. Why is this not the case with German Hip Hop? What are the differences between those two? Can we find a possible answer to this question? 
For the German songs I would use the playlist "Modus Mio" by Spotify which is described as the most important Hip-Hop-plalist in Germany and was also displayed as the first playlist when typing german hiphop. 
The latin plalist "Baila Reggeaton" can be found under the keywords "latin" and "urban". 
Because the German playlists result in "NA" results (and I have to ask my teacher about this) I had to think about a second idea which is presented below: 

Reggeaton playlist: 
meankey meanenergy meanmode
    <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>
    4.8      0.724     0.56

German playlist: 
 meankey meanenergy meanmode
    <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>
   NA         NA       NA
  
  
  
Research Question2: 
Description2: 
My second idea would be to compare the Playlist that spotify created of my top song in 2016 to my top songs in 2019. I think this might be very interesting aswell because there is a four year time span between those two years and I think I and also my taste in music changed a lot from the age of 17 to 21. Are there differences in audio features that I can interpret? Are there differences in styles?  

2016: 
  meankey meanmode meanenergy
    <dbl>    <dbl>      <dbl>
    5.50    0.485      0.669
  
2019: 
  meankey meanmode meanenergy
    <dbl>    <dbl>      <dbl>
    5.7     0.59      0.558
  
  The means I compared in this example do not show big differences, but i if my first idea does not work I could look into this more deeply.
