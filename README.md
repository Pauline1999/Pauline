Research Question1: How does Latin hip hop (Reggeaton) from today differ compared to German hip hop? Why is Reggeaton so popular and growing all around the world and German Hip Hop isnt? Can we find a possible answer to this question? 

Description1:
My actual idea is to compare the "Reggeaton" which is often described as a successor of hip hop to German hip hop. Reggeaton is becoming more and more popular all over the world and is listened by people who do not even unterstand the lyrics in spanish. Why is this not the case with German Hip Hop? What are the differences between those two? 

For the German songs I would use the playlist "Deutschrap Royal" by Spotify covering the most popular songs from the last months.  
The latin plalist "Baila Reggeaton" can be found under the keywords "latin" and "urban".

As we can see from the results looking at several audio features, there are some differences in for instance the loudness, where German hip hop seems to be a little louder(M=-6.28,SD=1.17) than Reggeaton songs(M=-4.67,SD=1.31). As I think one would have to look deeper to find more possible differences I would like to work on that research question. 

I am not sure whether the differences I presented in the tables are too small and therefore also thought about a second idea which is presented below: 
  
  
Research Question2: How do my favourite songs from 2016 differ from my top songs in 2019? How canthe differences or similarities be interpreted? 

Description2: 
My second idea would be to compare the Playlist that spotify created of my top song in 2016 to my top songs in 2019. I think this might be very interesting aswell because there is a four year time span between those two years and I think I and also my taste in music changed a lot from the age of 17 to 21. Are there differences in audio features that I can interpret? Are there differences in styles?  

2016: 
meankey meanenergy meanmode meaninstrumentalness meanliveness meanloudness meanspeechiness meantempo
  5.50      0.669    0.485               0.0102        0.214        -6.24           0.130      115.

2019:

 5.7      0.558     0.59               0.0250        0.189        -8.01           0.148      115.

Again for instance differences in loudness can be found when comparing the two playlist. The playlist in 2016 seems to contain less loud songs (M=-6.24,SD=1.99) than the playlist from 2019 (M=-8.01, SD=2.77).
